                <h2>Co-Founder, Chairman, And CEO Of Apple</h2>
                <p><b>Steven Paul Jobs </b>(February 24, 1955 - October 5, 2011) was an American 
                   entrepreneur, industrial designer, media proprietor, and investor. He was the co- 
                   founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of 
                   Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its 
                   acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely   
                   recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 
                   1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve 
                   Wozniak.
                   Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He 
                   was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before 
                   withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking 
                   enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple 
                   in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame 
                   and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first 
                   highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential 
                   of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user 
                   interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 
                   1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced 
                   computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 
                   1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to 
                   feature vector graphics.
